## Description
[Deployed App Link](https://notetaker12234.herokuapp.com/)

It is application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
Maybe after deployment, I can improve this app to be like a personal online notebook for me. I love writing & I can control the font.
